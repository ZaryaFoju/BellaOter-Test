# BellaOter-Test
Creating a mobile-first webpage as a short test.

Spent a total of three hours with the incomplete website. If I had more tme, I would implement 
the CSS to the actual products page and fill it out with better placeholder names. I would also
attempt to include a welcome back message if they have already visited.

Simply run it through the GitHub pages.
